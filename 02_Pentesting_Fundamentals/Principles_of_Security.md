# Principles of Security â€“ TryHackMe

## Overview
This room explores foundational principles of cybersecurity, focusing on the frameworks and models that underpin secure system design. It introduces the CIA triad, access control strategies, security models, threat modeling frameworks, and incident response processes. These are the building blocks of effective security policies and defense-in-depth strategies.

## ðŸ§© Key Concepts Covered

### CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** â€“ Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals.
- **Integrity** â€“ Ensuring information remains unaltered unless by authorized means.
- **Availability** â€“ Ensuring authorized users have access to data when needed.

### Access Control
- **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** â€“ Users should only have the minimum permissions required to perform their duties.
- **PIM vs. PAM** â€“ PIM maps organizational roles to access roles; PAM manages and audits those access privileges.

### Security Models
- **Bell-LaPadula (Confidentiality)** â€“ "No read up, no write down."
- **Biba Model (Integrity)** â€“ "No read down, no write up."

### Threat Modeling
- **STRIDE Framework** â€“ Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privileges.
- **PASTA Framework** â€“ Process-driven model focused on attack simulation and threat analysis.

### Incident Response
- **6 Phases** â€“ Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned.
- CSIRT teams are responsible for executing the IR plan during security events.

## ðŸ’¡ Takeaways
- Defense in Depth relies on layered security principles at technical, procedural, and administrative levels.
- The CIA triad is at the heart of all modern cybersecurity policies and decision-making.
- Understanding threat models like STRIDE helps proactively reduce system vulnerabilities.
- A structured Incident Response strategy minimizes damage and improves long-term resilience.
