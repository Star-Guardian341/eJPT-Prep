# Red Team Journey â€“ TryHackMe eJPT Prep

Welcome to my Red Team learning journey. This repository documents my hands-on progress through the [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) Junior Penetration Tester learning path as I prepare for the eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) certification.

My goal is to build real-world offensive cybersecurity skills while showcasing technical ability through clear documentation, tool usage, and practical examples.
